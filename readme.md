# Brawlhalla Rewards Bot
Ever tired of missing the Brawlhalla streams? Oh... you'ren't? 😦 

Either-way now you can just let this script run in the background that makes sure you do tune into all the twitch streams to maximize your rewards. 😛

## How does it work?
The script spawns a Chromium window to load the Brawlhalla twitch channel whenever a stream is scheduled to start. 

## Prerequisites
* Windows or Linux... if any mac user wants to use this please contact me I don't own a mac so I can't find chrome paths ❤️
* Node 16+
* Chromium (Google Chrome)
* Being logged into a twitch account in your browser

## Usage
Install dependencies with `npm i`

Start the script `npm run start`
